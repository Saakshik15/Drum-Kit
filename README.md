# Drum Kit Web App

- This repository contains a simple Drum Kit web application that allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keyboard keys or clicking on the virtual drum buttons. 
- The project mainly focuses on demonstrating the DOM manipulation features of JavaScript to create an interactive user experience.


## Features

- **Virtual Drum Set** : The web app simulates a drum set consisting of various drum components. Each drum component is associated with a specific keyboard key and produces a unique drum sound when activated.

- **Keyboard Interaction** : Users can play the drum sounds using their keyboard. Each drum sound corresponds to a specific key on the keyboard. Pressing the respective keys triggers the corresponding drum sound.

- **Button Click Interaction** : Users can also play the drum sounds by clicking on the virtual drum buttons displayed on the webpage. Each button represents a different drum component and produces a corresponding sound when clicked.

## Demo




## Tech Stack

- **HTML** : The HTML files (index.html) provide the structure and layout of the web app, defining the drum buttons and other necessary elements.

- **CSS** : The CSS stylesheet (styles.css) is used to style the web app, making it visually appealing and responsive.

- **JavaScript** (DOM Manipulation) : The JavaScript code (index.js) is responsible for the dynamic behavior of the web app. It handles the user interactions by detecting keyboard inputs and button clicks, and it manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) to play the appropriate drum sounds and create an interactive experience.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/saakshik15/drun-kit.git
```
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

3. Interact with the web app using either of the following methods:

- Keyboard: Press the keys corresponding to the drum buttons ('W', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'J', 'K', 'L') to play the associated drum sounds.
- Mouse: Click on the virtual instrument buttons to play the drum sounds.


## Credits

This web app was created for educational purposes and is inspired by various online tutorials and resources related to web development and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
